## âœ… Key Findings

- **OpenFDA grounding improves faithfulness**, but does not always improve accuracyâ€”especially when data coverage is incomplete.
- **MMR retrieval** occasionally retrieved more diverse or contextually aligned chunks than similarity-based methods.
- **Baseline (ungrounded) responses** were often surprisingly accurate and relevant.
- A **flexible prompting strategy** that encourages context use without suppressing LLM knowledge may yield better results.

## ðŸš€ Future Directions

- Expand the dataset with more diverse, clinician-submitted queries
- Combine OpenFDA with other structured clinical data sources (e.g., MIMIC-IV)
- Design RAG prompts with **fallback behavior** based on retrieval confidence
