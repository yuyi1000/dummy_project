## ðŸ“– Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medicine. However, their utility in non-generative clinical prediction, often presumed inferior to specialized models, remains under-evaluated. Our ClinicRealm study addresses this by benchmarking 9 GPT-based LLMs, 5 BERT-based models, and 7 traditional methods on unstructured clinical notes and structured Electronic Health Records (EHR).

Key findings from our study include:
*   **Unstructured Clinical Notes:** Leading LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek R1/V3, GPT o3-mini-high) in zero-shot settings now decisively outperform finetuned BERT models for clinical note predictions.
*   **Structured EHR Data:** While specialized models excel with ample data, advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek R1/V3) show potent zero-shot capabilities, often surpassing conventional models in data-scarce settings.
*   **Open-Source vs. Proprietary:** Leading open-source LLMs can match or exceed proprietary counterparts in these non-generative clinical prediction tasks.

These results establish modern LLMs as powerful tools for non-generative clinical prediction, particularly with unstructured text and offering data-efficient options for structured data, thus necessitating a re-evaluation of model selection strategies in predictive healthcare.
